## Here be Dragons!

The Vale compiler is *version 0.1.2*.

This means:

 * It works!
 * ...technically.
 * It's *still just a prototype.*
 * You can make any program in it, but you will probably need to work around some holes.

We've made several-thousand line long programs in it, but there are rough edges:

 * Most problems in Vale code have nice compile errors, but not everything. There will be the occasional compiler crash.
 * It's not optimized yet. In these early phases, we're prioritizing ease of experimenting over compilation speed, and we're using Scala which is already rather slow.
 * The standard library is quite small (just a list, hash set, hash map).

Download at your own risk, and report any bugs to the github!


## Releases

### 0.1.2 "Maya" Release

Download:

 * Linux: [ValeCompiler-0.1.2.2-Linux.zip](releases/ValeCompiler-0.1.2.2-Linux.zip)
 * Mac: [ValeCompiler-0.1.2.2-Mac.zip](releases/ValeCompiler-0.1.2.2-Mac.zip)
 * Windows: [ValeCompiler-0.1.2.2-Win.zip](releases/ValeCompiler-0.1.2.2-Win.zip)

This release adds:

 * Readonly and readwrite references!
 * Externs and exports!
 * A _lot_ of bugfixes! Special thanks (again!) to Ivo Balbaert for searching and finding so many bugs.

The .zip includes:

 * *valec.py*, the main python script for invoking the compiler. Use `python3 valec.py help` for help.
 * *vstl* contains some classes you may find useful, such as a list, hashset, and hashmap.
 * *BenchmarkRL*, a terrain generator written in Vale, useful for comparing different regions. If on Linux, use `benchmark.sh` to run it against various regions.
 * *samples*, a collection of small programs written in Vale.
    * *roguelike.vale* is a program where you are an @ sign and can walk in four directions.
    * The rest are tiny programs that serve as test cases for the compiler.
 * `builtins` should be ignored, these are .vale and .c files used by the compiler itself.


### 0.1.1 "Ivo" Release

Download:

 * Linux: [ValeCompiler-0.1.1.1-Linux.zip](releases/ValeCompiler-0.1.1.1-Linux.zip)

 * Windows: [ValeCompiler-0.1.1.0-Win.zip](releases/ValeCompiler-0.1.1.0-Win.zip)

This release adds:

 * A _lot_ of bugfixes! Special thanks to Ivo Balbaert for finding the rough edges and reporting bugs!
 * Much more solid and reproducible building and running of the Vale compiler.
 * More functions and classes to the standard library.
