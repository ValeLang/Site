<<<<
Here is a basic Spaceship struct, with a couple members.

We can construct it using its *constructor* function, which has the same name and was automatically generated.

All structs are *mutable* by default, more on that in the Mutability section below.
////
```Vale
struct Spaceship {
  name str;
  numWings int;
}

fn main() export {
  ship = Spaceship("Serenity", 2);
  println(ship.name);
}
```
```stdout
Serenity
```
>>>>


# Constructors

<<<<
We can specify a custom constructor for our struct.

We just need to give it the same name as the struct. [#  Inside the constructor, we must call either another constructor or `constructor<T>`.]
////
```Vale
struct Spaceship {
  name str;
  numWings int;
}
fn Spaceship() Spaceship {
  Spaceship("Serenity", 2)
}

fn main() export {
  ship = Spaceship();
  println(ship.name);
}
```

<slice/>


# Ownership


Every mutable struct has exactly one owning reference at any given time. [# There are other kinds of references (constraint, borrow, weak), [References](/guide/references) explains more.] [#ownership]

<<<<
When we create a mutable struct, we get the owning reference to it. When the owning reference disappears, the struct is automatically deallocated (via `drop`, explained below).
////
```Vale: `struct Spaceship { name str; fuel int; }`
fn main() export {
  ship = Spaceship("Serenity", 2);
  // ship is an owning reference

  println(ship.name);

  // implicitly drops ship
}
```
>>>>

<slice>
#ownership: Ownership is also found in C++ (`unique_ptr`), Rust, and Cyclone.

C also has "conceptual" ownership, in that we must track ownership without the language's help, to know when to `free` a struct.

Vale's ownership has the flexibility of C++'s `unique_ptr` without the mutability and aliasing restrictions of Rust and Cyclone, see [References](/guide/references) to learn how.
</slice>


## Lending

Every mutable struct has exactly one owning reference pointing to it.

<<<<
We can make another reference to a struct with the `&` symbol. It will be a non-owning reference. [# More specifically, a constraint reference, see [References](/guide/references).] This is called a *lend*.

In this example, the type of `owningRef` is `Spaceship`, and the type of `nonOwningRef` is `&Spaceship`.
////
```Vale: `struct Spaceship { name str; fuel int; }`
fn main() export {
  owningRef = Spaceship("Serenity", 2);
  nonOwningRef = &owningRef;
}
```
>>>>

<slice/>


## Moving

A local can give up the owning reference. Afterwards, that local is gone, and we cannot use it. This is called a *move*.

This is used to influence when the struct is `drop`ped, to keep it alive for longer or destroy it sooner.

<<<<
In this example, the `a` local is giving up the owning reference, and we're putting it into the `b` local.
////
```Vale: `struct Spaceship { name str; fuel int; }`
fn main() export {
  a = Spaceship("Serenity", 2); «alocal»
  b = a; // Move the ship from a to b.
  // b now owns the Spaceship.
  // Can't use a now.
}
```
>>>>

<<<<
It works the same way when passing an owning reference to a function.
////
```Vale: `struct Spaceship { name str; fuel int; }`
fn foo(b Spaceship) {
  println(b.name);
}
fn main() export {
  a = Spaceship("Serenity", 2);
  // Move the Spaceship from a
  // into foo's b
  foo(a);
  // Can't use a now.
}
```
>>>>


<slice>
#alocal: Rather than thinking "`a` is an owning reference", think instead that `a` is a *local* that *currently contains* an owning reference.

On the next line, `a` is destroyed, but the owning reference that it contained still lives on (inside `b`).
</slice>


## Drop

When an owning reference disappears, the struct is automatically deallocated. Vale does this by inserting a call to `drop`. [#drop]

The `drop` function is automatically generated for each struct and interface.

<<<<
Here we can see where the implicit call to `drop` is.

`drop` is called when the owning reference goes away, which in this case is `ship`.
////
```Vale: `struct Spaceship { name str; fuel int; }`
fn main() export {
  ship = Spaceship("Serenity", 2);
  // ship is an owning reference

  println(ship.name);

  // implicit ship^.drop().
}

// Implicit:
// fn drop(s Spaceship) {
//   destruct s; «destruct» // frees
// }
```
>>>>

We can specify our own `drop` function. A custom drop could be used to:

 * Remove this object from an observers list.
 * Commit a transaction.
 * Inform other objects of this object's destruction.

Rule of thumb: if something must happen at some point in the future, put it in a drop function. Vale will make sure that it's not forgotten. [#raii]

<slice>
#drop: Drop functions also appear in C++ ("destructors") and Rust. Vale's drop functions are like those but more flexible: they can return values and even take extra parameters. In those cases, they must be called manually. See [The Next Steps for Single Ownership and RAII](/blog/raii-next-steps) for more!

#destruct: The destruct keyword is syntactic sugar for a "move destructure" pattern, see [Pattern Matching](/guide/patterns) for more.

#raii: This is an incredibly powerful pattern, see [The Next Steps for Single Ownership and RAII](/blog/raii-next-steps) for more.
</slice>


# Mutability

By default, structs are *mutable*. We can make *immutable* structs with the *imm* keyword.

<<<<
After construction, an immutable struct cannot be changed at all.

Because of that, we can have multiple owning references to it, like Java or Python. [#small]

Vale also automatically derives the functions `println`, `str`, `hash`, `==`, and more.

Immutable structs cannot have drop functions. [# See [The Next Steps for Single Ownership and RAII](/blog/raii-next-steps) for the reasoning behind this.]
////
```Vale
struct Spaceship imm {
  name str;
  numWings int;
}

fn main() export {
  ship = Spaceship("Serenity", 2);
  ship2 = ship;
  println(ship.numWings);
  println(ship2.numWings);
}
```
```stdout
2
2
```
>>>>

<slice new-color="afterword">
#small:  Small immutable structs (32b or less) are copied and passed by-value. Larger objects use *SNRC* (strategic nonatomic reference counting) to free themselves.
</slice>


# Planned Features

These are planned features for Vale. See the [roadmap](/roadmap) for plans!


## Shortcalling Constructors

<<<<
We normally call a function by name, such as the `Spaceship("Serenity", 2)` above. However, if the code is expecting a certain type, it can automatically call the constructor of the expected type.
////
```Vale: notest
// Using above Spaceship struct

fn main() export {
  // These statements are equivalent:
  x Spaceship = Spaceship("Raza", 2);
  x Spaceship = ("Raza", 2);
}
```
>>>>

<<<<
This saves a lot of typing when calling functions.
////
```Vale: notest
// Using above Spaceship struct

fn foo(s Spaceship) { ... }

fn main() export {
  // These statements are equivalent:
  foo(Spaceship("Raza", 2));
  foo(("Raza", 2));
}
```
